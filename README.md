# Assignment-1-Rendering Pipeline and Rasterization
<h4>In this assignment you will learn the basics of rasterization. This will be an individual assignment and will require each one of you to submit their own file</h4>
<ol>
	<li> Read the basics of the OpenGL rendering pipeline from <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Rendering_Pipeline_Overview"> here</a></li> 	
	<li> Go through the basic code of making a triangle. Some references are <a href="https://github.com/paragchaudhuri/cs475-tutorials/tree/master/Tutorial_01"> this </a> and <a href="https://	learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Triangle"> this</a> </li>	
	<li> Go through problem 1 of the assignment pdf </li>
	<li> Read the rasterization slides of Prof. Parag Chaudhuri <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~paragc/teaching/2018/cs475/lectures/01_raster_basics.pdf"> here</a>. Also check <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Rasterization">this</a></li>
