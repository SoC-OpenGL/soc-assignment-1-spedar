# SoC Assignment1 - Deep Satra
<br>

In this directory, there is folder named **OpenGL-code** which further contains 3 parts of assignment.
<br>

## Running the Code

I have used GLEW, GLFW on Ubuntu. To compile code, open each subdirectory which has a **Makefile**. Type

      make

This will produce a single executable file **ring**. To run it, do 

    ./ring
